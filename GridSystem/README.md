# Grid System

Bootstrap offers a responsive Grid System. 

A Grid System divides a screen into multiple rows and columns. There is no restriction on the number of rows, but 
each row could contain up to 12 columns only. 

The column widths depend on the size of the screen they are displayed on. As the columns resize themselves dynamically 
based on the screen (including resized windows) they are displayed on, Bootstrap's grid system qualifies to offer a responsive design. 

It is recommended to place all the rows and columns inside a container to ensure proper alignment and padding. 

Bootstrap offers two types of containers classes

1. container, which creates a fixed-width container 
2. container-fluid, which creats a full-width fluid container
