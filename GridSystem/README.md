# Grid System

Bootstrap offers a responsive Grid System. 

A Grid System divides a screen into multiple rows and columns. There is no restriction on the number of rows, but 
each row could contain up to 12 columns only. 

The column widths depend on the size of the screen they are displayed on. As the columns resize themselves dynamically 
based on the screen they are displayed on, including resized windows, Bootstrap's grid system qualifies to offer a responsive 
design. 

After defining the rows and columns for a screen, HTML elements at desired locations. This helps in creating various types 
of layouts.
